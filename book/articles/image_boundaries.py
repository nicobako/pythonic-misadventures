# # Boundary Detection
#
# ```{note}
# Boundary detection refers to distinguishing unique objects in an image (e.g. these pixels are a unique object). Object detection refers to identifying unique objects in an image (e.g. this image contains a squirrel). This article is about boundary detection.
# ```
#
# There are plenty of tools available for performing image processing,
# but let's say that we want to implement our own *boudary detection* algorithm.
# How would you go about that?
# Here is my completely naive attempt at trying to solve this problem.
#
# Now, I'm not an image processing wizard, but my guess is that you would
# somehow need to compare pixel value(s) to their neighbour(s).
# A simple solution could look like this:
#
# * If pixel values are similar enough, then the pixels might belong to the same object.
# * If pixel values are not similar enough, then they belong to different objects.
#
# This seems simple enough, but in order to really
# solve this problem we will need to specify a few more things:
#
# * How do we determine *neighbors* of pixels?
# * What is our method for *comparing* pixel values?
# * How do we determine if pixels are *similar* enough?
# * What constitutes an *object*?
#
# We'll answer these questions one at a time and hopefully
# reach a satisfactory solution.
# First, let's load our image using *matplotlib* facilities.

# %%
from pathlib import Path

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import networkx as nx
import numpy as np
import PIL.Image

img_path = Path("../res/astronaut.png")
img = np.array(PIL.Image.open(img_path)) / 256.0

# ## Representing Connected Pixels
#
# We will use one of my favourite techniques: [graph processing with networkx](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/index.html)!
# Representing *connected items* is a problem that **screams**
# for a graph-processing solution.
#
# We will represent our image as a *networkx graph*.
# Later on, if we determine that pixels are connencted,
# we simply create a connection between the two pixels.

# ## Finding Neighbouring Pixels
#
# We will use a simple approach of just itereating over the rows and columns
# of our images. Pixels are adjacent to eachother if they are:
#
# * in the same row and adjacent column
# * in the same column and adjacent row


# %%

    nrows = g.graph["nrows"]

        for c in range(ncols - 1):
            yield (r, c), (r, c + 1)
    for c in range(ncols):
        for r in range(nrows - 1):
            yield (r, c), (r + 1, c)

# ## Comparing Pixel Values
#
# Imagine if we treat all the pixels in an image as vectors.
# Vectors have both _magnitude_ and _direction_.
# The [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product)
# is a mathematical operation that can be used to compare the magnitude
# and direction of two vectors. I'm not a mathematician so I won't pretend to fully
# understand how it works... that's why I've added a link for more details.
# Could we use this simple measurement as a means for comparing pixel values?
#
# We have an image already, so let's plot a histogram
# of all of our dot products so we get an idea of what we're working with.

# %%
dots = []
for s, t in pixel_neighbor_iterator(g):
    dots.append(np.dot(g.nodes[s]["color"], g.nodes[t]["color"]))
plt.hist(dots)
plt.show()

# ## Determining if Pixels are Connected
#
# The *dot product* of two vectors returns a single value (i.e. a *float*).
# Could our logic be as simple as computing the dot product of two pixels,
# and it is below some threshold, then we can assume the pixels belong to the same object?


# %%
def are_pixels_connected(p1, p2, dot_threshold: float) -> bool:
    dot = np.dot(p1, p2)

    if abs(dot) <= dot_threshold:
        return True

# ## Determining Objects in Image
#
# We are representing an object as a collection of pixels, right?
# If multiple pixels are connected, that's an object, right?
# We can add some logic to our algorithm so that objects must be
# made up of a minimum number of connected pixels.
#
# Now, lets put it all together.
# We will be given an image, and we want to follow all of the steps
# outlined above to split up the image into objects.

# ## Conclusion
#
# I'm actually quite impressed with this.
# It worked out much better than I expected!
#
# There could be countless ways of doing this better.
# Namely, use an image proceesing library!
